## Overview

TestHub is an AI-powered, full-stack test management platform that supports the complete software testing lifecycle. It brings together **AI requirement analysis and test case generation**, **test case management and reviews**, **API testing**, **Web UI automation**, **Android app automation**, **performance testing**, and a **test data factory** to help teams improve testing efficiency.

## Features

### AI capabilities

- **Requirement analysis:** Upload PDF, Word, or TXT documents and use AI to extract business requirements and generate test cases.
- **AI assistant:** Integrate with Dify to provide testing guidance and answer questions.
- **Intelligent browser automation:** Use Browser Use to understand pages and complete testing tasks in text or visual mode.
- **Multiple model providers:** Configure providers such as DeepSeek, Qwen, SiliconFlow, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google Gemini.

### Test case management and reviews

- Manage the full test case lifecycle, including creation, editing, versioning, and archiving.
- Organize cases by project, version, and tags, with structured preconditions, steps, and expected results.
- Collaborate through attachments and team comments.
- Run reviews with multiple reviewers, templates, checklists, threaded review comments, and status tracking.

### API testing

- Test HTTP and WebSocket APIs with tree-structured collections, environments, and variable substitution.
- Run test suites in batches with configurable assertions and execution order.
- Review request history, schedule tasks with email or webhook notifications, and generate Allure reports.

### Web UI automation

- Choose Selenium or Playwright, with support for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.
- Manage elements with multiple locator strategies and organize code using the Page Object Model (POM).
- Edit scripts visually, run suites in batches, and capture logs, screenshots, and video recordings.
- Schedule runs with cron expressions, fixed intervals, or one-time execution.
- Use AI mode to understand page structure and carry out testing tasks.

### Android app automation

- Use Airtest image recognition with local emulators or remote devices; device locking helps avoid resource conflicts.
- Manage image, coordinate, and region-based elements with multi-resolution support.
- Build reusable components and UI Flow workflows, with global, local, and output variables.
- Execute tasks asynchronously with Celery, generate Allure reports, and track progress over WebSocket.

### Performance testing

- Manage and run Locust load tests, and review performance metrics and reports.

### Test data factory

- Access more than 50 utilities for text processing, encoding, random data, encryption and decryption, test data generation, JSON processing, and cron expressions.
- Organize data with tags and usage history, and reference it directly in API and UI tests.

### Security and collaboration

- Use JWT access and refresh tokens with automatic renewal, logout blacklisting, and replay protection.
- Manage multiple projects, member roles and permissions, and release plans.
- Send unified notifications through email and WeCom, DingTalk, or Feishu webhook bots.

## Technology Stack

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python:** 3.12 recommended; other versions may have compatibility issues.
- **Node.js:** 18+ for frontend builds; not required on production servers serving prebuilt assets.
- **MySQL:** 8.0+
- **Java:** 17+ (optional; required to generate Allure reports).
- **Redis:** 6.0+ (optional; required for app automation WebSockets and Celery).
- **Browser drivers:** ChromeDriver or GeckoDriver for UI automation; these can also be downloaded with a management command.

### Backend setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd testhub_platform
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # Linux / macOS
   source venv/bin/activate

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:

   ```bash
   # Update database, Redis, email, and other settings as needed.
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Initialize the database:

   ```bash
   # Create the database.
   mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE testhub CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;"

   # Apply migrations and create an administrator account.
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

5. Optionally initialize module data:

   ```bash
   # UI automation locator strategies
   python manage.py init_locator_strategies
   # APP automation component pack
   python manage.py load_component_pack
   ```

6. Start the services you need:

   ```bash
   # Django development server (HTTP only)
   python manage.py runserver

   # Use Daphne instead when APP automation WebSocket progress is required.
   daphne -b 0.0.0.0 -p 8000 backend.asgi:application

   # Optional: API/UI scheduled task scheduler
   python manage.py run_all_scheduled_tasks

   # Optional: Celery worker for asynchronous APP automation
   celery -A backend worker -l info
   ```

### Frontend setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev        # Development server
npm run build      # Production build
```
